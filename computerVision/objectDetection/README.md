Programs to perform object detection to identify fish in video frame.

The implemented	models are RCNN of TensorFlow and YOLOv3 using 

YOLO was run based on this implementation 

https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3

It also contains a custom detector for finding objects in a video

The results for my implementation can be found in ConfusionMatrixYOLO.csv

Just make sure that you get the data from the dropbox and place in the custom data folder and train the model accordingly.
